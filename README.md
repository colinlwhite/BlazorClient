# Blazor Client
This is an introductory overview of Blazor Client or Blazor WebAssembly. 
This project covers how Blazor Client looks, runs and its most important features such as it being client-side only similar to Angular, React or Vue. 
Eventually, I will compare Blazor Client to ASP.NET Core's other four project types.
