# Blazor Client
This is an introductory overview of Blazor Client or Blazor WebAssembly. 
This project covers how Blazor Client looks, runs and its most important features such as it being client-side only similar to `Angular`, `React` or `Vue`. 
Eventually, I will compare Blazor Client to ASP.NET Core's other four project types. 

# Short Description
Blazor Client is more focused on offline access on the client-side.
It has rich interactivity, no full-page refreshes and minimal lag time.
Blazor Client does not have `Startup.cs` or `appsettings.json`.
It enables Progressive Web Applications as well.
